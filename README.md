💡 Assumptions & Design Choices

Movie data is fetched from a static JSON file for simplicity.

Local storage is used to store the watchlist.

Designed for single-user interaction; no authentication yet.

Functional components and React Hooks are used for state management.

CSS files are used for styling with a focus on clean UI and smooth animations.

🔮 Future Improvements

Integrate with a real movie API (e.g., TMDB) for dynamic data.

Add user authentication and personalized watchlists.

Movie detail pages with ratings, trailers, and reviews.

Implement advanced search features with debounce and caching.
